## Miro Prototyping plugin
This plugin allows you to add clickable hotspots to a Miro board which can then be linked to widgets on the board. Entering preview mode allows you to click on hotspots to navigate between frames.

This plugin uses the Miro SDK and requires you to give it read and write permissions to boards you have access to. You can add this plugin to your boards by visiting this link: [https://miro.com/oauth/authorize/?response_type=code&client_id=3074457364657223133&redirect_uri=%2Fconfirm-app-install%2F](https://miro.com/oauth/authorize/?response_type=code&client_id=3074457364657223133&redirect_uri=%2Fconfirm-app-install%2F)

### Features
* Drag and drop hotspots onto boards
* Link hotspots to any widget
* Preview mode hides lines and focuses on widgets
* Choose a panel to start the first time you launch preview mode
* Hotspots flash when a non-hotspot area is clicked in preview mode
* Ability to navigate backwards steps in preview mode
* Viewport resets when leaving preview mode
* Connecting lines are given a unique style to match the style of hotspots

### Limitations
* Hotspots are not attached to the widgets they cover, so if widgets are moved, you also need to move the hotspot
